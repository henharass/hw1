# hw1 <br>
To execute this python program, you should first download the .py file and the .csv file with data. Then use the command `python hw1.py` to compile and run the program in the direct file. After this, you will get the analysis result of the .csv file, which shows the maximum TEMP value from five stations respectively. (The data whose value of the TEMP is '-99.000' or '-999.000' is excluded.)
